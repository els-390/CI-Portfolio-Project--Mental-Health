### Inital Design Thoughts and Ideas

 As this website is to inform users about mental health, why it is important and how to seek support and further information so I would like to include a calming design and colour scheme without lots of dynamic elements and piece of content. 

 ## Colours and Images 

 I will select a carefully considered set of images to include that don't clash with the colour scheme, are diverse and inclusive and match the content being described and featured. 

Using the [ColorZilla Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp) I can select colours from my background image to use in the rest of my webpage design to ensure the colours do not clash.
