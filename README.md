## UX 

### The Brief: 

#### Project 4: Mental Health Awareness

##### External User’s Goal:

The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health, including how to recognize common issues and manage stress, presented in a supportive and organised layout.

##### Site Owner’s Goal:

The site owner wants to create a welcoming webpage that provides basic mental health information using a clean and supportive design. The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a calming and well-organised user experience.

### Purpose

This project is designed to be a one page resource on Mental Health showcasing HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The project will provide a resource to help its users to understand what is mental health, why it is important, how to maintain good mental health and where to go to find support.

### Target Audience

The target audience for this website will include: Individuals seeking help for their mental health, health and care providers and professionals, and members of the general public. 

It will be accessible to a wide range of users from different demographics and marginalised communities. 


### Inital Design Thoughts and Ideas

 As this website is to inform users about mental health, why it is important and how to seek support and further information so I would like to include a calming design and colour scheme without lots of dynamic elements and piece of content. 

## Typography

Font decisions based around what is most accessible and clear for users accessing the website and its content from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).


 ## Colours and Images 

 Careful selection of colours that contrast but don't detract from the website content or images.
 
 Colours selection from the hero image at the top of the page using  [ColorZilla Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp) and refined using [Color Space](https://mycolor.space/gradient3?ori=to+right+top&hex=%23003055&hex2=%2336686E&hex3=%23D5E8E6&submit=submit) to create a colour pallette.

### Colour pallette

I wanted to use a colour pallette that kept inline with the clean and supportive experience. For that reason I wanted to use a green pallette as that often promote the feelings of renewal, tranquility, growth, and inspiration.

#### Typography

Playfair Display - used for headers as its a stylish serif font that aligns with my concepts of bring a calming experience to the user.

Roboto - used for main bodies of text as it is simple and highly readable emphasising the ease of use. 

Font awesome for any icons used.
