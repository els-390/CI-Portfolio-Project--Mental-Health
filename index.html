        "We would never tell someone with a broken leg that they should stop wallowing and get it together. We don’t
        consider taking medication for an ear infection something to be ashamed of. We shouldn’t treat mental health
        conditions any differently.”
        Michelle Obama

        "The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle,
        known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have … an understanding of life that
        fills them with compassion … a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen."
        Elisabeth Kübler-Ross

        Sometimes self-care is exercise and eating right. Sometimes it’s spending time with loved ones or taking a
        nap … Whatever soothes your soul."
        Nanea Hoffman

        “Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”
        Albus Dumbledore from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

        “It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.”
        Aristotle

        “There is a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in”
        Leonard Cohen

        “Increasing the strength of our minds is the only way to reduce the difficulty of life.”
        Mokokoma Mokhonoana

        “Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves”
        Henry David Thoreau

        “I am not afraid of storms for I am learning how to sail my ship.”
        Amy March, from Little Women

        “Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think, I’m not going to make it, but you laugh inside
        — remembering all the times you’ve felt that way.”
        Charles Bukowski

        “Promise me you’ll always remember — you’re braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter
        than you think.”
        Christopher Robin from Winnie the Pooh

        “In the middle of winter I at last discovered that there was in me an invincible summer.”
        Albert Camus

        “If you’re going through hell, keep going.”
        Winston Churchill
